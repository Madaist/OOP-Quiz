A class that contains at least one pure virtual method is called:
a
abstract class
b
base class
c
derived class
d
friend class
 a
2
Operator overloading is a representation of:
a
run-time polymorphism
b
compile-time polymorphism
c
RTTI
d
function overriding
 b
3
Inheritance means:
a
protecting the attributes using acces modifiers
b
the same variable is shared by all the istances of a class
c
converting identifiers into addresses 
d
a new class is made by keeping the properties of an already existing class and adding some own properties
 d
4
A static method:
a
can use any type of variable inside its body
b
can only use static or global variables
c
can have two versions: static and ne-static
d
can have two versions: static and virtual
 b
5
A copy constructor is NOT called when:
a
an object of the class is returned by value
b
an object of the class is passed (to a function) by value
c
an object of the class is passed (to a function) by reference
d
an object of the class is constructed based on another object of the same class
 c
6
It's NOT a form of compile-time polymorphism:
a
function overloading
b
virtual functions
c
templates
d
operator overloading
 b
7
In the case of private inheritance:
a
private members of the base class are accessible in the derived class
b
public members of the base class become protected members in the derived class
c
protected memebers of the base class become private members in the derived class
d
protected members of the base class are not accessible in the derived class
 c
8
Virtual inheritance is used to:
a
avoid ambiguity created by the diamond problem
b
access virtual functions
c
access pure virtual functions
d
create an object of an abstract class
 a
9
The operators that can not be overloaded are:
a
. :: ? ()
b
[] :: ? ->
c
<< >> :: ?
d
:: ? .* .
 d
10
When an exception is thrown but there's not a try block the exception was thrown from:
a
an error occurs
b
the program works perfectly fine
c
the program ends with terminate()
d
the program ends with unexpected()
 a
